Configuring Python environments
Note: If you're looking to get started with Python in Visual Studio Code, refer to the Tutorial. This present article is 
focused only on aspects of setting up a Python interpreter/environment.

An "environment" in Python is the context in which a Python program runs. An environment consists of an interpreter and any 
number of installed packages. Because many programs are written specifically for a certain Python interpreter and makes use 
of a set of libraries, developers often create and manage an environment for individual programs.

When working with Python in VS Code, you select from available environments using the Python: Select Interpreter command. The
Python extension then uses that selected environment for IntelliSense, auto-completions, linting, formatting, and any other 
language-related features. (The environment is not, however, used for debugging; see Choose a debugging environment.)
